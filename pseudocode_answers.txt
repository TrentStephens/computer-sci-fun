Questions

> 1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode in order to wrap their head around how a project might work. By writing
out the steps of the code, programmers can logically see where they should start coding and the 
steps that will need to be taken in order to get to the end. Having a plan in place means programmers
won't waste time working on a piece of code that won't get used in the end. Pseudocode is a powerful
tool that can stop problems from cropping up during the development process.

> 2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Running pseudocode on a computer wouldn't do anything. It are just words that approximate what code 
should do, it is not an actual programming language.

###Programming Assignment

> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

numberA is undefined
numberB is undefined
INPUT a number for numberA and numberB
IF numberA is greater than numberB THEN
	PRINT numberA
ELSE IF number B is greater than nmberA THEN
	PRINT numberB
ELSE
	PRINT "These numbers are equal"
END IF

> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT total to 0
WHILE the number is not 100
	Add 1 to the number
	PRINT the number
END WHILE

> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INIT Array of names
INIT Array of phone numbers
SEARCH for name
	RETURN name AND number IF there is a match (full or partial)
OR
SEARCH for number
	RETURN name and number if there is a match (full or partial)

> Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var data = [
  {
    name: 'Devin Smith',
    ph: '555-5551',
    address: '100 Main Street'
  },
  {
    name: "Mark Johnson",
    ph: '555-5552',
    address: '500 Main Street'
  }
];

function search(query){
  let match = [];
  query = query.toLowerCase();
  data.forEach((entry)=>{
    
    Object.keys(entry).forEach((key)=>{
     
      if(entry[key].toLowerCase().indexOf(query)>-1){
        match.push(entry);
      }
    })
  })
  return match;
}

console.log(search("Devin"));
