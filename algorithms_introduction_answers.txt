2. Amazon - They have created an algorithm for how to deliever packages all over the United
States in 2 days at the click of a button. They have streamlined the process for many people
and have made it seem like anything that takes longer than 2 days is a long wait.
Instagram - Has created an algorithm for how to display posts so someone's feed. This is 
a controversial algorithm because people claim they just want to see posts in reverse order,
but their data has suggested that people interact more often with posts that have been
served up via their algorithm
Facebook - Facebook has created a lot of algorithms, but the one I want to focus on is one
that detects the reliability of news items. They suffered backlash for how their platform
was used leading up to the 2016 presidential election, so they needed to make a change. 
They have made an effort to clean up their "fake news" problem and it has helped them gain
back trust from the public.

3. An efficient algorithm is one that uses as few steps as possible but still ends up with
the most effective results. Algorithms become inefficient once they start taking too long
to get to the optimal answer or the final result isn't optimal despite fewer steps.
