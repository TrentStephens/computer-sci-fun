1. A binary tree is a type of tree data structure where each node points may point to a right
or left child node. Different rules can be created for what data is held in each node, left
or right.

2. A heuristic is a best guess for how to solve a complex problem that might not be 100%
accurate, but makes up for the lack of efficiency by saving tons of time.

3. A heuristic could be implemented in a "Search" feature so that the code expects certain
words or phrases to be searched and can serve up that information quicker than if the
code had to run though every possible piece of data it could search through.

4. A depth-first search will start searcing at the root of a tree and go all the way down
until it reaches an end. It will then backtrack until it finds another path to go down. This
will be repeated until all nodes are searched. Breadth first search starts at the root of a
tree, then will search the data from all the nodes on the next level down, and move onto the
next level after that, and so on until all levels are searched.
