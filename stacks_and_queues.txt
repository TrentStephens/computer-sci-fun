Questions

1. The main difference between a stack and a queue is how they access the data. A stack
uses Last In First Out logic where the most recent data is accessed first. A queue uses
First In First Out where the oldest data is accessed first.

2. Stacks and Queues are similar in the regard that they are different ways to organize data
to be accessed by the code at some point.

3. If I were a developer I would utilize LIFO to implement an UNDO/REDO feature in a word
program. This is because I would want to be manipulating the most recent data which is what
happens in Last in Last Out, the last element is first to leave.
