1. There are pros and cons to using a linked list instead of an array. The main pro is that
linked lists take up much less space than arrays because the data doesn't have to be stored
all at once. A disadvantage is that since the elements in a linked list aren't always stored
in active memory, it can take longer to access the data compared to an array that just needs
to reference an objects index.

2. A linked list is kind of like a scavenger hunt. In order to find the data you're looking 
for, you have to start with an initial clue (the Head Node) and go from node to node until
you find the specific data you are looking for.
